<h1>Intro To Resume</h1>
<p>
Our world went nasty on us. 
<br>
But even in this ill climate, we still need more. We are re-designing the way businesses and schools
work by communicating online. Perhaps it is a new phase in industry and society. Our businesses that
went bust need to be reopened - perhaps renamed and redesigned. But things will
gradually get back to normal, probably differently than you imagined. We'll use cutting edge 
technology more and more, such as robots, AR, and deep learning. So this is the starting point at 
which I will be going, and I will rise high!
</p>
<p>
Here is a short sum-up of my work-intended features. Mind you, my real name is
concealed because of spam and overload of "new friends" on social media. My moniker is "Norman 
Greenson," I am Asian, but things Westernized and in English are good.

<h2 id="resumeTitle">Norman Greenson's Resume</h2>
<h3 class="sectionTitles" class="bold-text">Languages understood</h3>
<ol class="lists">
    <li>English (US)</li>
    <li>Mandarin non-written (East China)</li>
    <li>A teeny bit of Cantonese meant for survival in this metropolitan jungle</li>
</ol>
<p class="intros">
Why it is that I am not great at either Mandarin or Cantonese, even being a Hong Kong resident? 
I actually "skipped" delving into Chinese when I was 7 years old in the US, which means I never 
got the initiation of Chinese. I resumed Chinese studying when I was 14. But my English
was primed to be my top language - I was top English student into grade 9, after which I competed
among more brainy competition in a Hong Kong school.

</ol>
<p class="intros">
Although I should consider art my best ability,
I have adherence to technology also because of my lifelong passion in dealing with bits and bytes.
I am in a quest to earn real respect. Creative writing? N/P. Visualization? OK. But all of Javascript? Part of the quest but is a lot.
Who knows all the frameworks and add-ons, anyway? Should I be a front-end? To master something in 
tech... Of course it's worth a go.
