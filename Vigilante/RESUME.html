<h1>Intro To Resume</h1>
<p>In these dark days of dreadful virus avoidance, some of our best (and worst)
human features show. In the adoption of new tolerance methods, such as Zoom calls
and Nintendo Switch, we have made some good use of the time in the last
two years--while full of both fear and hope of getting out of this murk that is the virus.
</p>
<p>
We need more. We need a new phase in industry and society. Our businesses that went
bust need to be reopened - perhaps renamed and redesigned. But things will
gradually get back to normal, differently probably than you imagined it might. 
This is not the worst Pandemic ever. That was the Plague that killed not 3 million,
but more like 30 million in Europe.
</p>
<p>
When we get to the safe part, the author and this Resume will become final. Will you come back to read it?
</p>
<p>
If not, here is a short sum-up of my features. Mind you, my real name is concealed 
because of spam and overload of "new friends" on social media. My moniker is "Norman 
Greenson," I am Asian, but I like many things Westernized and in English.

<h3 class="sectionTitles" class="bold-text">Languages</h3>
<ol class="lists">
    <li>English (US)</li>
    <li>Mandarin non-written (East China)</li>
    <li>A teeny bit of Cantonese meant for survival in this metropolitan jungle</li>
</ol>
<p class="intros">
Why it is that I am not great at either Mandarin or Cantonese, even being a Hong Kong resident? 
I actually "skipped" delving into Chinese when I was 7 years old, which means I never got the 
initiation of Chinese. I resumed actual Chinese studying when I was 14. But my English
was primed to be my top language - I was top English student into grade 9, after which I competed
among brainy competition in a Hong Kong school. 
</p>
<h3 class="sectionTitles">
Basic abilities
</h3>
<ol class="lists">
    <li>12-grade or Form 7 math, Pure 2 Calculus (UK)</li>
    <li>Web development to a basic level, trained on Codecademy.com</li>
    <li>Javascript deeply trained on udemy.com</li>
    <li>Philosopy, history, art history, biology learned during a short stint of college in US</li>
    <li>iPad Pro artwork, traditional fundamental art-paintings and pencil work</li>
    <li>Stories for Movies</li>
    <li>Freshly made keyboard recordings (on Garageband, so far)</li>
    <li>Love to exercise</li>
</ol>
<p class="intros">
My third goal in life is to do cool things and be recognized in some way. But my first and second goals 
in life are secrets - you may only find out if you know me well.
</p>
<h3 class="sectionTitles">
Professional skills
</h3>
<ol class="lists">
    <li>Movie script writing ability</li>
    <li>High fantasy imagination and artwork</li>
    <li>Algorithms in Java, Javascript and HTML, PHP, and soon, Python AI</li>
    <li>Adherence to technology and plain being nerdy!</li>
    <li>Need to advance these areas because of a need to work and do productive things</li>
</ol>
<p class="intros">
As you can see, movie script writing is the first line in the list. Why is that so? Because 
my first movie is coming out in 2022! I will command some parts of its production. Millions of 
USD for its budget--but will it really return 100%? 200% or even more?
I also have adherence to technology also because of my lifelong passion in dealing with complex 
computers. I just want people to respect me for something other than movies, 
which is one thing, but if I create cool web sites I could be considered job-ready.
</p>
<p class="sectionTitles">Movies = fame </p>
<p class="sectionTitles">Website = professionalism</p>
<p class="sectionTitles">Art = pride</p>
