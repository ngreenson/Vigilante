    It was a dark and stormy night. Dark knight arrives on his BatBike. He scopes out 
    the crime scene. Well, there have actually been no crimes committed. But dark knight
    is vigilant, and lusting for avengeance. He wants somebody to pay. Somebody's gonna
    get IT.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the side, the boy wonder also enters the scene. He notices little goons chuckling beside the 
    supermarket. &quot;24/7&quot;, the boy wonder mutters. He stealthily follows them with his eyes. 
    They don't notice.
    </p>
    <p>
    Suddenly, a cry of pain blasts out from one of the goons. Boy wonder exclaims: &quot;I got him!
    I got him!&quot; while wrestling with one of the Heretic goons. &quot;Good job, boy wonder!&quot;
    dark knight quips. One down, 277 to go...

    Our mission on Earth is finished to destroy big badness evils and their &quot;goons&quot;! We
    are celebrating by creating a symbolic web page, this Exaction of Avengeance piece, which 
    signals that we have undoubtedly completed our vengeful attack on all these evils and saved hundreds of
    million lives while at the same time, solved 35 major illness and reduced hundreds 
    of minor problems out of about 3700 total illnesses. But you know, medicine must continue. So pay
    homage to all those who work on the front lines, fearlessly, and tirelessly.
